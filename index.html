            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p> Welcome to the website! 
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm Parker, a student at UW-Madison studying computer science. 
                This website has been created to give you just a little bit of
                insight into who I am and what I enjoy doing!
                <br>
                <br>
                This website has been split into three pages. While I didn't find
                any space to put my lackluster musical abilities, there's still
                enough information to go around!
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>HOME: </b> This is the home page! You're here right now!
                This page is a brief introduction to who I am and a table of
                contents as to what this website holds.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>THE BOARD: </b>I host trivia night twice a week. The Board is
                a list of some of the not-so-good answers I have recieved while
                working.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>PENGUIN PUSH: </b>I'm studying computer science. Of course I know
                my way around a computer! This page lets you play a small game I 
                made a few years ago in a high school coding class.
