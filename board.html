            <p>
                Welcome to The Board!
                <br>
                <br>
                I regularly host trivia nights twice a week. While most people 
                put in a good effort and at least give their best guess for each 
                question, some people will instead give me as funny or stupid of 
                an answer as possible.
                <br>
                <br>
                The board is an out of context list of these answers. The only 
                context you need is that actual people gave me these answers.
